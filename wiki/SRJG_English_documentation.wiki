(Movie_Filter) , cd2 must be written so that the 2nd part of the movie
(cd2)<br>
does not get included in the Jukebox. An icon will appear on the movie
thumbnail, top right to indicate that there is a second part. While
viewing, <br>
at the end of the first part, or if you press stop, the second part
will automatically start.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
=Organizing Files and folders=
<br>
==Movies==
<br>
You have a lot of freedom in the organization of your files: movies are
automatically detected in many types of directory trees.<br>
<br>
{{{
Main Folder
   | - Movie 1
   | - Movie 2   
Main Folder
   | - Feature Film 1         
           | - Movie 1
   | - Feature Film 2 
           | - Movie 2
Main Folder 
   | - other folder with all the movies 
           | - Movie 1
           | - Movie 2 
           | - ...
           |-- other folder
                   | - Movie 333    
                   | - Movie 334 
                   | - ... 
}}}
<br>
The location of the "Main Folder" is the path of movies. It should be
entered in the config file, or the menu interface configuration RSS. <br>
For the path /tmp/usbmounts/sdb1/Movies we have: <br>
<br>
{{{<Movies_Path>/tmp/usbmounts/sdb1</Movies_Path>}}}<br>
<br>
Note that there is a / at the end of the path. 
<br>
==The poster (Thumbnail), images (moviesheet) and Nfo files.==
<br>
The poster/thumbnail are small images (often the posters of movies) in 150x220.<br>

The images (moviesheets) are 1280x720. They contain a wide array of information about the movie, images of the movie, a summary etc ...<br>

Nfo files, include all information in text format about the movie. it will be used by the jukebox to find:<br>

-The original title of the film and the display instead of the filename. If you see the file name when you select a movie in the Jukebox it usually means that the Nfo file was not found, does not exist or nfo file does not follow the naming convention.<br>
- The movie genre. When you search for a genre, eg science fiction, you will find all movies that include the science fiction genre in the Nfo file. A movie can have several genre.<br>
- The year of the movie. When you search for a year, eg "2011", you will find all the movies that specify that release year in the Nfo file.<br>

All these files must have the same name as the film (note that names are case sensitive, it means respecting upper / lower case):<br>

Example:<br>

My_Movie.avi<br>
My_Movie.jpg<br>
My_Movie_sheet.jpg<br>
My_Movie.nfo<br>

Depending on the settings in the config file, these files can be located at various locations:<br>

Nfo_Path, Poster_Path and Sheet_Path may have the following values:<br>

MoviesPath: Corresponds to the "movies path". Files will be in the same directory as the movie files.<br>
SRJG: Corresponds to a sub folder in the movie path <movie path>/SRJG/ImgNfo<br>
Path: This path must point to a folder that already exists <br>

Nfo_Path, Poster_Path and Sheet_Path can have paths different from each other.<br>
For example:<br>

{{{
<Movies_Path>/tmp/usbmounts/sdb1/Movies/</Movies_Path>
<Nfo_Path>MoviesPath</Nfo_Path>
<Poster_Path>/home/Images/Posters/</Poster_Path>
<Sheet_Path>SRJG</Sheet_Path>
}}}

<br>
This can be useful when the films are stored on a write-protected partition (NAS), you may decide to have movies on your NAS and supporting files on a local disk in your player.  This could also speed up navigation since all the images for the thumbnail/moviesheet will be access on the local drive versus the NAS.<br>

==How to automatically thumbnails, movieSheet images and Nfo files using IMDB==

SRJG is able to create these files for you (no need for Thumbgen, Sheetmaker, YAMJ or other utility).

https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-dEqggOwjwhk/T2j6TVb621I/AAAAAAAAA-w/YzTzeMob5q8/s700/srjg_menu_imdb.jpg

By default Imdb option is disabled: it is very time consuming, since it will allow SRJG to fetch the images on the internet and information. How long depends on the number of movies for which you want to collect images, but also the speed of your Internet connection.<br>
 
If Imdb is activated, the images and Nfo files will be retrieved and created when you run an update Jukebox. Whether it's a fast update, or rebuild, SRJG will begin by retrieving those files before updating the movies. Imdb will not replace thumbnails, MovieSheets and Nfo files that you already have, it will simply create the one that are absent.<br>

This process is completely anonymous, there is no collection of information.<br> 
Here's how it works:<br> 

-Search on your player for missing thumbnails, Moviesheets or Nfo files.<br>
 
-Removal of certain characters in file names to be as close to the actual movie name to help with the api search.<br>

-Send titles generated by the Api playon.unixstorm.org<br>

-Playon.unixstorm.org interrogate official servers like imdb, allocine.fr etc.. to retrieve the images and movie information.<br> 
  

Collecting sites (imdb, allocine.fr etc...) only sees the api from Playon.unixstorm.org.<br>

 
=List of parameters= 

If the images generated are not suitable, or the information corresponding to other movies, this is typically because the name of your files are not quite the movie name. Start by checking the name of your files.<br>
